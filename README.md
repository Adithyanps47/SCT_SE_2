## 📋 Description
A modern, interactive desktop game built with Python and `CustomTkinter`. Unlike standard terminal-based guessing games, this application features a polished Graphical User Interface (GUI) with visual feedback, difficulty settings, and score tracking.

This project was developed using **Visual Studio Code** as part of the **SkillCraft Technology** internship program (Software Engineering Track).

## ✨ Features
* **Modern GUI:** Clean, light-themed interface using `CustomTkinter`.
* **Dynamic Difficulty:** Select from Easy (1-10), Medium (1-50), or Hard (1-100).
* **Visual Feedback:** Color-coded hints (Blue for "Too Low", Red for "Too High", Green for "Win").
* **Score Tracking:** Real-time attempt counter to challenge the user.
* **Input Validation:** Prevents crashes if non-numeric characters are entered.
